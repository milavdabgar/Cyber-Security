### Asymmetric Encryption

#### Principles
Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, uses a pair of keys for encryption and decryption: a public key and a private key. The public key is available to everyone, while the private key is kept secret.

1. **Public Key**:
   - Used to encrypt data.
   - Shared openly so anyone can encrypt a message intended for the owner of the corresponding private key.

2. **Private Key**:
   - Used to decrypt data.
   - Kept confidential and only accessible to the owner.
   - Ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt the message.

#### Scenarios Enhancing Data Security
1. **Secure Communication**:
   - **Example**: Email encryption using PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).
   - **Process**: The sender encrypts the email with the recipient's public key. The recipient then decrypts it with their private key.

2. **Digital Signatures**:
   - **Example**: Verifying the authenticity of a document.
   - **Process**: The sender signs a document with their private key. The recipient uses the senderâ€™s public key to verify the signature, ensuring the document's integrity and authenticity.

3. **Key Exchange**:
   - **Example**: Establishing a secure communication channel using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
   - **Process**: Both parties exchange public keys to create a shared secret, used for symmetric encryption during the session.

4. **Secure Websites (SSL/TLS)**:
   - **Example**: HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) used by websites.
   - **Process**: The server provides its public key to the client during the SSL/TLS handshake. The client uses this public key to encrypt a session key, which is then used for symmetric encryption of data.

### Private and Public Key Cryptography (Asymmetric Encryption)

#### Introduction
Asymmetric encryption, or public key cryptography, involves the use of two keys: a public key and a private key. This method addresses the limitations of symmetric encryption, which relies on a single key for both encryption and decryption and thus has challenges in key distribution and management.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Public Key**:
   - **Nature**: Publicly accessible.
   - **Use**: Encrypts data.
   - **Sharing**: Can be distributed widely without compromising security.

2. **Private Key**:
   - **Nature**: Kept secret and secure.
   - **Use**: Decrypts data encrypted with the corresponding public key.
   - **Sharing**: Never shared; remains confidential to its owner.

#### Working Mechanism
- **Encryption**: A sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the data. Since the public key is not secret, it can be shared openly.
- **Decryption**: Only the recipient can decrypt the data using their private key, ensuring that the communication remains secure even if the public key is widely known.

#### Detailed Example
1. **Secure Message Transmission**:
   - **Step 1**: Alice wants to send a confidential message to Bob.
   - **Step 2**: Bob provides Alice with his public key.
   - **Step 3**: Alice uses Bob's public key to encrypt the message.
   - **Step 4**: Bob receives the encrypted message and uses his private key to decrypt it.
   - **Outcome**: Only Bob can read the message, ensuring confidentiality.

2. **Digital Signatures**:
   - **Purpose**: To ensure the authenticity and integrity of a message.
   - **Step 1**: Bob wants to send a signed document to Alice.
   - **Step 2**: Bob uses his private key to sign the document, creating a digital signature.
   - **Step 3**: Bob sends the signed document to Alice.
   - **Step 4**: Alice uses Bob's public key to verify the signature.
   - **Outcome**: If the signature is valid, Alice is assured that the document is from Bob and has not been tampered with.

#### Algorithms Used
- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: One of the first and most widely used asymmetric algorithms, suitable for encryption and digital signatures.
- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**: Provides similar security to RSA but with shorter key lengths, making it more efficient.
- **DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)**: Specifically designed for digital signatures.

#### Advantages
1. **Enhanced Security**: Even if the public key is known, itâ€™s computationally infeasible to derive the private key.
2. **No Key Distribution Problem**: Public keys can be shared openly, avoiding the issues of secure key distribution faced in symmetric encryption.
3. **Digital Signatures**: Provides a mechanism to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document.

#### Disadvantages
1. **Performance**: Generally slower than symmetric encryption due to complex mathematical operations.
2. **Key Management**: Requires careful management of keys, particularly ensuring the private key remains confidential.

#### Real-World Applications
1. **Secure Web Browsing (HTTPS)**:
   - SSL/TLS protocols use asymmetric encryption to establish a secure connection between a browser and a server. The server's public key is used to encrypt a session key, which is then used for faster symmetric encryption during the session.

2. **Email Encryption (PGP/GPG)**:
   - Users can encrypt their emails using the recipientâ€™s public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the message using their private key.

3. **Cryptocurrency Transactions**:
   - Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use public and private keys to secure transactions. The public key serves as an address for receiving funds, while the private key allows the owner to access and spend the funds.

#### Memorization Hints
- **Public Key**: **P**ublic **E**ncrypts (PE).
- **Private Key**: **P**rivate **D**ecrypts (PD).
- **Digital Signatures**: **P**rivate **S**igns (PS), **P**ublic **V**erifies (PV).
- **Key Exchange**: **P**ublic for **E**xchange, **S**hared secret for **S**ession (PE-SS).

### Hashing Algorithms

#### Definition
A hashing algorithm is a function that converts an input (or 'message') into a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a hash value or hash code. The output is usually a unique representation of the input data.

#### Key Properties
1. **Deterministic**: The same input will always produce the same hash value.
2. **Fixed Size**: Produces hash values of a fixed length regardless of the input size.
3. **Pre-image Resistance**: Difficult to reverse the hash function to obtain the original input.
4. **Small Changes, Large Difference**: A small change in input produces a significantly different hash value.
5. **Collision Resistance**: It is hard to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.

#### Common Hashing Algorithms
1. **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**:
   - **Output Length**: 128-bit hash value.
   - **Use**: Originally used for data integrity checks, now considered insecure due to vulnerabilities.

2. **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)**:
   - **Output Length**: 160-bit hash value.
   - **Use**: Used in SSL/TLS and some cryptographic applications, but now largely replaced due to vulnerabilities.

3. **SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2)**:
   - **Variants**: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512.
   - **Use**: Widely used in security protocols and applications for data integrity and authentication.

4. **SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)**:
   - **Latest Standard**: Designed as a drop-in replacement for SHA-2, offering enhanced security.

#### Applications
1. **Data Integrity**:
   - **Example**: Ensuring files are not tampered with during transmission.
   - **Process**: Compute the hash of the original file, send the file and the hash, and the recipient computes the hash of the received file to verify integrity.

2. **Password Storage**:
   - **Example**: Storing hashed passwords instead of plaintext passwords in databases.
   - **Process**: User passwords are hashed before being stored, so even if the database is compromised, the plaintext passwords are not exposed.

3. **Digital Signatures**:
   - **Example**: Signing a document to ensure it has not been altered.
   - **Process**: The hash of the document is encrypted with the senderâ€™s private key to create a digital signature. The recipient decrypts the signature with the senderâ€™s public key and verifies it by computing the documentâ€™s hash.

4. **Blockchain**:
   - **Example**: Ensuring the integrity of transactions in a blockchain.
   - **Process**: Each block contains a hash of the previous block, creating a chain that is secure against tampering.

#### Hashing in Digital Communication
1. **Message Authentication Codes (MAC)**:
   - Combines a secret key with the hash function to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
   - **Use**: Common in secure communication protocols.

2. **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)**:
   - Uses a cryptographic hash function and a secret key.
   - **Use**: Provides a way to verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message.

### MD5 Hashing Algorithm

#### Introduction
MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 and has been widely used in security applications and for data integrity verification.

#### Working Mechanism
The MD5 algorithm processes the input data in 512-bit blocks. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step overview of the MD5 hashing process:

1. **Padding the Message**:
   - The original message is padded to ensure its length is congruent to 448 modulo 512. Padding is done by appending a single '1' bit followed by '0' bits until the length is 448 modulo 512.
   - The length of the original message (before padding) is appended as a 64-bit value at the end of the padded message.

2. **Initialize MD5 Buffer**:
   - MD5 uses four 32-bit variables (A, B, C, D) initialized to specific constants:
     - A = 0x67452301
     - B = 0xEFCDAB89
     - C = 0x98BADCFE
     - D = 0x10325476

3. **Processing Message in 512-bit Blocks**:
   - The message is processed in chunks of 512-bit blocks, with each block being further divided into 16 words of 32 bits each.
   - The MD5 algorithm uses four non-linear functions (F, G, H, I) and 64 predetermined constant values (T[i]).

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop consists of four rounds, each with 16 operations. Each operation involves a non-linear function, modular addition, and a left bitwise rotation.
   - The functions used in each round are as follows:
     - Round 1: F(B, C, D) = (B & C) | (~B & D)
     - Round 2: G(B, C, D) = (B & D) | (C & ~D)
     - Round 3: H(B, C, D) = B ^ C ^ D
     - Round 4: I(B, C, D) = C ^ (B | ~D)

   - The operations for each round update the values of A, B, C, and D using the message words and constant values.

5. **Add Length of Message**:
   - After processing all blocks, the resulting values of A, B, C, and D are concatenated to produce the final 128-bit hash value.

#### Example of MD5 Process
Suppose we want to hash the message "abc":

1. **Original Message**: "abc"
2. **Padding**: 
   - Convert "abc" to binary.
   - Append '1' bit, then '0' bits until the length is 448 modulo 512.
   - Append the length of the original message (24 bits) as a 64-bit binary value.
3. **Initialize Buffers**: 
   - A = 0x67452301
   - B = 0xEFCDAB89
   - C = 0x98BADCFE
   - D = 0x10325476
4. **Process Message in Blocks**:
   - The padded message is divided into 512-bit blocks.
   - The main loop processes each block, updating A, B, C, and D.
5. **Final Hash**: 
   - Concatenate the final values of A, B, C, and D.
   - The resulting MD5 hash for "abc" is: `900150983cd24fb0d6963f7d28e17f72`.

#### Security Considerations
- **Collision Vulnerabilities**: MD5 is no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities that allow attackers to create different inputs with the same hash value.
- **Not Recommended**: Due to these vulnerabilities, MD5 should not be used for applications requiring collision resistance, such as digital signatures or SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Alternative Algorithms**: More secure hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and SHA-3 are recommended for cryptographic applications.

#### Memorization Hints
- **MD5 Steps**: **P**adding, **I**nitialization, **P**rocessing, **A**dd Length (PIPA).
- **Rounds Functions**: F (AND/OR), G (AND/OR), H (XOR), I (XOR/NOT) - remember as **F**antastic **G**reat **H**ashing **I**nstructions.

### SHA Hashing Algorithm

The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) family is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The SHA family includes SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. Here, we will focus on SHA-1 and SHA-2, as SHA-0 is deprecated and SHA-3 has a different internal structure.

#### SHA-1

**SHA-1** produces a 160-bit hash value. It was widely used in various security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, and IPsec. However, due to vulnerabilities, it is no longer considered secure for many applications.

**Steps in SHA-1**:
1. **Padding the Message**:
   - The original message is padded to make its length congruent to 448 modulo 512. Padding is done by appending a single '1' bit followed by '0' bits until the length is 448 modulo 512.
   - The length of the original message is appended as a 64-bit integer.

2. **Initialize Variables**:

     - h1 = 0xEFCDAB89
     - h2 = 0x98BADCFE
     - h3 = 0x10325476
     - h4 = 0xC3D2E1F0

3. **Process Message in 512-bit Blocks**:
   - Each 512-bit block is divided into sixteen 32-bit words.
   - The algorithm processes each block through four rounds of 20 operations each.

4. **Compression Function**:
   - For each of the 80 rounds, SHA-1 uses one of four predefined functions (F1, F2, F3, F4) and constants (K1, K2, K3, K4).
   - Each function is applied to the variables and message words, updating the hash values.

5. **Output**:
   - The final hash value is obtained by concatenating the values of h0, h1, h2, h3, and h4.

#### SHA-2

**SHA-2** includes six hash functions with different digest sizes: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, and SHA-512/256. Here, we will focus on SHA-256 and SHA-512.

**SHA-256**:
- **Output Length**: 256 bits.
- **Steps in SHA-256**:
  1. **Padding the Message**:
     - Similar to SHA-1, but the padding ensures the message length is congruent to 448 modulo 512 for SHA-256.
  2. **Initialize Variables**:
     - Uses eight 32-bit variables initialized to specific constants:
       - h0 = 0x6A09E667

       - h5 = 0x9B05688C
       - h6 = 0x1F83D9AB
       - h7 = 0x5BE0CD19
  3. **Process Message in 512-bit Blocks**:
     - Each block is processed in 64 rounds using functions and constants specific to SHA-256.
  4. **Compression Function**:
     - For each round, the message schedule array and compression function update the hash values.
  5. **Output**:
     - The final hash value is obtained by concatenating the values of h0 to h7.

**SHA-512**:
- **Output Length**: 512 bits.
- **Steps in SHA-512**:
  1. **Padding the Message**:
     - The padding ensures the message length is congruent to 896 modulo 1024.
  2. **Initialize Variables**:
     - Uses eight 64-bit variables initialized to specific constants:
       - h0 = 0x6A09E667F3BCC908
       - h1 = 0xBB67AE8584CAA73B
       - h2 = 0x3C6EF372FE94F82B
       - h3 = 0xA54FF53A5F1D36F1
       - h4 = 0x510E527FADE682D1
       - h5 = 0x9B05688C2B3E6C1F
       - h6 = 0x1F83D9ABFB41BD6B
       - h7 = 0x5BE0CD19137E2179
  3. **Process Message in 1024-bit Blocks**:
     - Each block is processed in 80 rounds using functions and constants specific to SHA-512.
  4. **Compression Function**:
     - For each round, the message schedule array and compression function update the hash values.
  5. **Output**:
