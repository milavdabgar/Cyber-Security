#### Q.1 (c) Explain MD5 hashing algorithm. (07)

**MD5 Hashing Algorithm:**

**Introduction:**
The MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value from an arbitrary amount of input data. Developed by Ronald Rivest in 1991, MD5 is commonly used for verifying data integrity.

**Properties of MD5:**
- **Fixed Output Size:** Regardless of the input size, MD5 produces a fixed 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, typically represented as a 32-character hexadecimal number.
- **Deterministic:** The same input will always produce the same hash output.
- **Fast Computation:** Designed for rapid computation, making it efficient for use in various applications.
- **Pre-image Resistance:** It should be computationally infeasible to reverse the hash function to obtain the original input from its hash value.
- **Collision Resistance:** It should be computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output (though this property has been compromised over time).

**Steps of the MD5 Algorithm:**

1. **Padding:**
   - The input message is padded so that its length is congruent to 448 modulo 512. Padding ensures that the message length (in bits) is 64 bits less than a multiple of 512.
   - A single '1' bit is added to the end of the message, followed by '0' bits until the length condition is met.
   
2. **Appending Length:**
   - A 64-bit representation of the original message length (before padding) is appended to the padded message. This step ensures that the total length is a multiple of 512 bits.

3. **Initialize MD Buffer:**
   - Four 32-bit variables (A, B, C, D) are initialized with fixed hexadecimal values:
     - A = 0x67452301
     - B = 0xEFCDAB89
     - C = 0x98BADCFE
     - D = 0x10325476

4. **Processing Message in 512-bit Blocks:**
   - The padded message is divided into 512-bit (64-byte) blocks. Each block is processed in a series of operations involving bitwise functions and modular arithmetic.
   - For each block, the algorithm performs 64 iterations, grouped into four rounds of 16 operations each.
   - The main operations involve non-linear functions (F, G, H, I), modular addition, and bitwise rotation.

**MD5 Functions:**
- **F(X, Y, Z) = (X & Y) | (~X & Z)**
- **G(X, Y, Z) = (X & Z) | (Y & ~Z)**
- **H(X, Y, Z) = X ^ Y ^ Z**
- **I(X, Y, Z) = Y ^ (X | ~Z)**

**Example Operations:**
For each 512-bit block, the following operations are applied:
- **Round 1:** Uses the function F, with operations like:
  - **a = b + ((a + F(b, c, d) + M[k] + T[i]) <<< s)**
- **Round 2:** Uses the function G.
- **Round 3:** Uses the function H.
- **Round 4:** Uses the function I.

Here, M[k] represents a 32-bit chunk of the current block, T[i] is a constant derived from the sine function, and <<< denotes left bitwise rotation.

5. **Finalization:**
   - After processing all blocks, the contents of the buffer (A, B, C, D) are concatenated to form the final 128-bit hash value.

**Applications of MD5:**
- **Data Integrity:** Verifying the integrity of files and data during transmission or storage.
- **Digital Signatures:** Creating digital signatures for verifying the authenticity of messages and documents.
- **Checksum:** Generating checksums for quick data verification.

**Security Concerns:**
- **Collision Vulnerabilities:** Over time, weaknesses in MD5 have been discovered, allowing for collision attacks where two different inputs produce the same hash.
- **Deprecated Use:** Due to its vulnerabilities, MD5 is no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes and has been largely replaced by more secure algorithms like SHA-256.

**Conclusion:**
The MD5 hashing algorithm, despite its historical significance and widespread use, has been rendered insecure due to collision vulnerabilities. It remains a useful tool for non-cryptographic applications but should be avoided for security-critical purposes.

#### Q.2 (a) What is digital signature ? Explain digital signature properties. (03)

**Digital Signature:**

**Definition:**
A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a digital message, document, or software. It is the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or a stamped seal, but it offers far more inherent security.

**How It Works:**
- **Key Pair Generation:** The signer generates a pair of keys: a private key (kept secret) and a public key (shared with everyone).
- **Signing Process:** 
  - The sender creates a hash of the message or document.
  - The hash is then encrypted using the sender's private key to create the digital signature.
- **Verification Process:**
  - The recipient uses the sender's public key to decrypt the digital signature, revealing the original hash.
  - The recipient also generates a new hash of the received message or document.
  - If the decrypted hash matches the newly generated hash, the message's authenticity and integrity are confirmed.

**Properties of Digital Signatures:**

1. **Authenticity:**
   - **Verification of Identity:** Digital signatures authenticate the identity of the sender, ensuring that the message or document is indeed from the claimed sender. Since only the signer has access to their private key, the recipient can be confident of the sender’s identity.

2. **Integrity:**
   - **Data Integrity Assurance:** Digital signatures ensure that the content of the message or document has not been altered after it was signed. Any modification in the message will result in a different hash value, thus revealing tampering.

3. **Non-Repudiation:**
   - **Prevention of Denial:** Once a message is signed digitally, the signer cannot deny having signed it. This property provides legal proof of the sender's identity and the integrity of the signed document, preventing the sender from denying their involvement.

**Applications:**
- **Secure Communications:** Digital signatures are widely used in secure email communications, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of email contents.
- **Software Distribution:** Software developers use digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of software updates and downloads.
- **Legal and Financial Documents:** Digital signatures are used to authenticate and secure legal contracts, financial transactions, and other important documents.

#### Q.4 (b) Describe Session Hijacking in detail. (04)

**Session Hijacking:**

**Definition:**
Session hijacking, also known as session sidejacking or cookie hijacking, is a type of cyber attack where an attacker takes over a user's session by obtaining the session ID. The session ID is a unique identifier that the server assigns to a specific user session. Once the attacker gains access to the session ID, they can impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the user's data and actions within that session.

**How Session Hijacking Works:**

1. **Session Establishment:**
   - When a user logs into a web application, the server creates a session and assigns a unique session ID to the user's session.
   - This session ID is typically stored in a cookie, URL, or hidden form field.

2. **Session ID Interception:**
   - **Network Sniffing:** An attacker uses packet sniffing tools to capture network traffic. If the traffic is not encrypted (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS), the attacker can easily extract session IDs from the captured packets.
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the web application to inject malicious scripts. These scripts can then steal session IDs from the user's browser.
   - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** The attacker intercepts the communication between the user and the server, capturing the session ID in the process.
   - **Session Fixation:** The attacker sets a known session ID for the user before they log in. Once the user logs in with the known session ID, the attacker can use the same session ID to hijack the session.

3. **Session Takeover:**
   - After obtaining the session ID, the attacker can use it to send requests to the server, impersonating the legitimate user.
   - The server, recognizing the session ID as valid, grants the attacker the same access and permissions as the user.

**Consequences of Session Hijacking:**
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can access sensitive information such as personal details, financial data, and confidential documents.
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the user, such as making unauthorized transactions, changing account settings, or sending malicious messages.
- **Privacy Breach:** Users' private information can be exposed or misused.
- **Reputation Damage:** Organizations can suffer reputational damage if user data is compromised.

**Prevention Measures:**

1. **Use Secure Communication Channels:**
   - **Encryption:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the user's browser and the server, preventing attackers from intercepting session IDs.
   - **Secure Cookies:** Use secure cookies with the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` attributes. The `Secure` attribute ensures cookies are sent only over HTTPS, and `HttpOnly` prevents access to cookies via JavaScript.

2. **Implement Strong Session Management:**
   - **Regenerate Session IDs:** Regenerate session IDs after login, privilege changes, and periodically during a session to reduce the risk of session fixation attacks.
   - **Short Session Lifetimes:** Use short session lifetimes and implement automatic session expiration to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.

3. **User Education and Best Practices:**
   - **Logout Mechanism:** Encourage users to log out after their session, especially on shared or public computers.
   - **Avoid Public Wi-Fi:** Advise users to avoid accessing sensitive information over public Wi-Fi networks without a secure VPN.

4. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - **Vulnerability Assessments:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and fix security flaws that could be exploited for session hijacking.
   - **Penetration Testing:** Perform penetration testing to simulate attacks and test the effectiveness of security measures.

**Conclusion:**
Session hijacking is a serious security threat that can lead to unauthorized access and significant damage. Implementing strong security measures, such as using secure communication channels, regenerating session IDs, and educating users on best practices, is crucial to protecting user sessions from being hijacked.
